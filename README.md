# Predictive Modeling for Health Conditions
## Project Overview ðŸ˜‡
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of developing heart disease, mental health issues, asthma, and skin cancer. By analyzing clinical and lifestyle data, our models aim to provide early warnings to individuals at risk, thereby supporting preventive healthcare measures.

## Features ðŸ¤¯
Comprehensive Data Analysis: Utilization of statistical analysis and data visualization to select and engineer features.
Advanced Predictive Modeling: Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms to optimize prediction accuracy.
Iterative Testing and Refinement: Continuous model improvement based on feedback and new data.

## Getting Started ðŸ«¥
Quickly get the project up and running with `poetry`:
```bash
poetry run streamlit run Main_Page.py
```

A Dockerfile is included if you want to deploy the website yourself!

```bash
docker build . -t app
docker run -p 80:8501 app
```

Note that the website runs in debug mode by default.
Set `DEBUG=false` in your environment to disable debug logs.
This is already done in the Dockerfile.
